This repository contains four important files:

1. `Tableaus.ipynb` is the Python notebook that contains all the actual code I've written for this project; each block has a brief header describing what's in it

2. `tableaus.md` is a markdown file containing the 10 input tableaus used for my paper

3. `output_tableaus.md` was generated by running the Tableaus Python notebook over the tableaus in the input file

3. `output_tableaus_remove_maxobj.md` was generated by running the Tableaus Python notebook over the tableaus in the input file, but with the MaxObj constraint intentionally removed from the algorithm

If one wished to run this algorithm over their own set of tableaus, they would need to (1) write an input style in the format seen in tableaus.md, and (2) edit the Tableau class's `constraints` class attribute to be a list of their own constraints.

There is also a directory called `Old`, which contains nothing relevant to the final paper I've written but I've saved for posterity; it's mostly me messing around with treebanks that I ultimately did not use.
